# Basic analysis of Census earnings data

This repo contains scripts to download, analyze, and plot data from
the Current Population Survey (CPS), a household survey conducted by
the US Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More
specifically, it uses the Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORG)
dataset produced by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which
consists of CPS households who have been asked questions about their
earnings.
